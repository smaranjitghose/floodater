Who doesn't love the monsoon😘?

The romantic atmosphere, chilling effect, those evening savouries and the very sound of rain itself is mesmerizing to most of us.

While being proporous in many cases like farming the rains can cause havoc too if it happens continuously in excess,

One of the most drastic cases in recent times ⌚was the [2018 Kerala Floods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Kerala_floods) that claimed many
lives🏊‍♀️and damaged proporty🛠 worth millons in the Indian state of Kerala. 🛶

# How can AI🤖 help?

Using various machine learning techniques over a dataset that gives us the annual rainfall ⛈ of the state from 1901 to 2018 for the state of
Kerala, we can attempt to accurately predict🔮 if there's a high chance of rainfall for a particular year/month and build a flood alert ❗
system using this so that prior arrangements are made to save life👫 and property🏨.

#### A bird eye view of what we use under the hood🔍 : 

- __K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)__
- __Logistic Regression(LR)__
- __Support Vector Machines(SVM)__
- __Decision Trees(DT)__
- __Random Forest(RF)__

#### Dataset💿 :

The [dataset]((https://github.com/smaranjitghose/floodater/blob/master/data/kerala_rainfall.csv)) used for this has been made from [India Rainfall Data](https://data.gov.in/catalog/rainfall-india?filters%5Bfield_catalog_reference%5D=1090541&format=json&offset=0&limit=6&sort%5Bcreated%5D=desc)
shared by India Meteorological Department(IMD),Govt. of India under [Government Open Data License](https://data.gov.in/government-open-data-license-india)

#### Results📊 :

We can clearly see that using Logistic Regression, we get the highest accuracy 🥇and hence we can use it for our automatic flood alert system
